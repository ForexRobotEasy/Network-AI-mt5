# Network AI mt5

Network AI mt5 is an expert advisor developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It is an AI-powered forex trading software that uses macroeconomic data and news events to make trading decisions.

To use this expert advisor, you need to include the necessary libraries: Trade.mqh and WebRequest.mqh. These libraries provide the necessary functions for executing trading operations and accessing web data.

The main trading operations are executed in the OnTick() function, which is called on every tick of the market. The expert advisor checks for news events using the IsNewsEvent() function and analyzes macroeconomic data using the AnalyzeData() function. Based on the analyzed data, it determines whether to open a position using the ShouldOpenPosition() function. If a position should be opened, it calls the OpenPosition() function. Similarly, it checks if a position should be closed using the ShouldClosePosition() function and calls the ClosePosition() function to close the position.

The expert advisor also includes an initialization function OnInit() and a deinitialization function OnDeinit(). In the OnInit() function, it enables WebRequest and sets the WorkMode to mode_Real. In the OnDeinit() function, you can add any cleanup code that needs to be executed when the expert advisor is stopped.
